# rusty-gba
A Game Boy Advanced emulator written in the Rust programming language

This project is in its very early stages and still a work in progress!

Goals:
* Threadded ARM and Thumb interpreter
* ARM/Thumb to x86 JIT compiler
* Efficient GBA memory map emulation
* GBA bios emulation
* Screen emulation
* Sound emulation

A successful project should be able to run a GBA rom as it would on the hardware.
